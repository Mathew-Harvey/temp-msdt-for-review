# Revolutionizing Underwater Inspections and Biofouling Management: How MarineStream Enables Efficient, Safe, and Compliant Fleet Operations

*Published: July 24, 2025*

Hull inspections remain one of the most expensive, resource-intensive, and risk-prone aspects of vessel maintenance, with traditional methods often falling short in efficiency, safety, and consistency—especially across large, multi-vessel fleets.

MarineStream, in collaboration with Fremantle Ports and the Department of Primary Industries and Regional Development, recently demonstrated cutting-edge hull-cleaning technology that allows for in-water vessel cleaning directly in ports—transforming the future of ship hull maintenance.

The trial showcased advanced in-water cleaning technology on the pilot vessel Paddy Troy, with third-party environmental monitoring from O2 Marine. Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs) were deployed to perform underwater inspections, assessing biofouling extent and environmental risks.

Currently, port regulations prohibit hull cleaning in port waters due to environmental concerns. MarineStream has conducted what is believed to be the first voluntary assessment against Australia’s proposed Anti-fouling and In-water Cleaning Guidelines, demonstrating a commitment to pioneering marine biosecurity through transparency and innovation. By leading this effort ahead of full implementation, MarineStream is setting a national benchmark for proactive environmental stewardship in the maritime sector.

This case study explores this innovation and how MarineStream empowers large organizations to standardize hull inspections and biofouling management across fleets. By integrating hardware like ROVs, crawlers, and filtration systems with the MarineStream software platform (available at app.marinestream.io), MarineStream delivers a consistent, repeatable approach for pre-clean inspections, classification surveys, and Underwater Inspections in Lieu of Drydocking (UWILD). The outcome is a scalable framework that enhances safety, accelerates reporting, and ensures fleet-wide compliance with biosecurity and class requirements—all while maintaining divers for specialized niche cleaning and engineering tasks, with ROVs handling monotonous, repetitive work.

“MarineStream has not only established a clear methodology for efficient data collection but also created a complete framework for end-to-end biofouling management, including AI-powered reporting tools and blockchain-based compliance databases for visibility and accountability. The hardware ensures reliable, high-quality data capture that supports the entire process,” noted Serena Brown, Global Business Development Manager at Deep Trekker.

## What’s the Difference Between UWILD and Biofouling Inspections?

MarineStream provides inspection solutions meeting both classification society and environmental requirements—two distinct but overlapping compliance areas. This dual capability lets vessel operators consolidate workflows using advanced hardware and the MarineStream platform.

Their integration demonstrates how MarineStream leads in supporting major operators and navies with international standards, shifting toward standardized, digital-first underwater compliance across fleets.

### What is UWILD (Underwater Inspection in Lieu of Drydocking)?

UWILD inspections, mandated by societies like DNV, ABS, and Bureau Veritas, allow vessels to maintain class certification without drydocking, if performed by approved providers and reviewed by surveyors.

Class certification verifies hull integrity, machinery, safety systems, and maintenance meet standards. Without it, vessels cannot operate legally, insure, or remain commercially viable. Classification typically excludes fouling conditions.

### What Are Classification Societies and Why Do Their Standards Matter?

Classification societies like DNV, ABS, and Bureau Veritas are independent bodies establishing technical standards for ships and offshore structures, covering hull integrity, propulsion, maintenance, and safety.

Maintaining class is crucial for safety certification, insurance, and operations. MarineStream offers in-water services aligned with these, providing UWILD via class-approved ROV workflows and clear, auditable evidence without service removal.

By pairing hardware like Deep Trekker ROVs with the MarineStream platform, inspections are compliant, efficient, and repeatable. Surveyors access live video, detailed reports, and approvals remotely—cutting costs and disruptions.

### What You Need to Know About Conducting an Effective UWILD

A comprehensive guide to successful UWILD, including checklists, certifications, and considerations, is available through MarineStream’s resources.

### What is Biofouling Management?

Biofouling inspections fall under environmental frameworks, especially in Australia where IMO guidelines are law. They target marine organism buildup on hulls as biosecurity risks.

Vessels entering Australian ports need Biofouling Management Plans and Record Books, inspected by recognized providers like MarineStream.

While ROVs aren’t required, they offer advantages in reducing diver exposure, speeding data collection, and enhancing transparency. MarineStream enables continuous compliance, avoiding port denials, delays, and disruptions.

## How MarineStream Supports Fleet-Wide Compliance

This supports UWILD and biosecurity inspections, positioning MarineStream at the forefront of compliance. Global organizations manage inspections, documentation, and approvals from one platform, regardless of authority or type.

## Why Are In-Water Hull Inspections So Challenging Today?

Traditional inspections are resource-heavy, costly, and risky, relying on divers and outdated gear lacking consistent coverage in poor visibility or currents. Regulatory scrutiny on biofouling and species transfer adds complexity.

Drydocking faces capacity limits, delays, and costs. In-water alternatives are safer but challenge visibility, accuracy, and environmental sensitivity.

“We’re seeing more demands for non-drydock inspections,” said Tom Hazel. “Drydock is expensive and sidelines vessels. ROVs deploy quickly for consistent data, improving processes.”

MarineStream addresses pain points like biosecurity compliance, diver risks, turbid conditions, and auditable reporting with integrated solutions.

Challenges in port environments include poor visibility from sediment, currents, and low light, requiring robust camera systems.

Regulatory pressures, safety risks, and harsh conditions drive MarineStream’s efficient, safer approaches while preserving high-quality data.

"As we look at the shipping industry, a key challenge is limited drydocking capacity. Operational tempos compress maintenance windows. We’re introducing technologies for underwater sustainment, including cleaning, inspection, maintenance, and repair via divers, ROVs, non-destructive testing, welding, and biofouling strategies," noted Adam Falconer-West.

## The Solution to Drydock Limitations: In-Water Hull Inspections Using Hardware and Digital Workflows

MarineStream employs a hybrid model, integrating ROVs, crawlers, filtration, and the platform for accurate in-water assessments. Compact ROVs like REVOLUTION and PIVOT, with UHD 4K cameras, sonar, and DVL, handle challenging conditions while divers focus on complex tasks.

Data syncs to the platform for repeatable reports, critical for regulators and defense.

The platform offers live streaming, automated reports, and remote collaboration, allowing transparent, real-time access.

This combination reduces drydock reliance, lowers costs, and boosts compliance, with filtration ensuring environmental safety during cleanings.

Deploy ROVs for rapid, safe hull inspections in any condition.

## What Types of Underwater Inspections Can Be Done with ROVs?

MarineStream uses ROVs for biofouling management and structural assessments across civilian, commercial, and military contexts, emphasizing precision and repeatability.

### Hull and Biofouling Inspections

ROVs monitor hull conditions, inspecting waterlines and depths for fouling and coatings.

Pre-clean inspections evaluate and document biofouling. As Mat Harvey described in a Fremantle Ports project: “We completed a comprehensive inspection in 45 minutes using ROVs connected to the platform, producing reports with evidence—all safely without divers in water.”

### Mooring Chain and Subsea Infrastructure

ROVs inspect chains and infrastructure for corrosion and wear, reducing diver risks in deep or hazardous areas.

“ROVs enable inspections where diving is inefficient, supporting maintenance scheduling,” said Tom Hazel.

Two-stage deployments maximize bottom time.

### Port and Harbor Assessments

ROVs assess infrastructure in sediment-heavy areas, delivering high-quality imaging in low visibility.

Hand-launched from small vessels, they minimize downtime, with data integrated into the platform.

### Environmental Monitoring

ROVs check turbidity and growth, verifying post-clean debris containment with minimal disturbance via GPS-tagged video.

### Compliance Inspections for Vessel Entries

ROVs support pre-entry checks, providing geotagged evidence for regulatory alignment.

## How Do ROVs Improve Diver Safety and Inspection Efficiency?

ROVs act as force multipliers, enhancing operations while prioritizing safety.

### Improving Safety and Reducing Diver Exposure

ROVs minimize risks by handling initial inspections in hazardous environments, allowing divers for niche tasks only.

“When using ROVs, you remove people from hazards,” said Adam Falconer-West.

### Increasing Efficiency and Reducing Downtime

Inspections drop from 8-10 hours to 3, enabling multiple daily tasks and rapid mobilization.

### Supporting and Monitoring Diver Operations

ROVs provide live visuals during diver work, improving coordination.

“We use ROVs for pre/post-inspections, sending divers only for what machines can’t handle,” said Marc Green.

### Extending Operational Reach

ROVs free divers for dexterous tasks, running concurrently for efficiency.

Camera systems excel in turbidity, supporting biosecurity verifications.

### Enhancing Real-Time Diver Support

Portable ROVs track divers, boosting awareness and documentation.

### Supporting Offshore and Defense Operations

ROVs extend reach in deep or contaminated waters, enabling staged, targeted dives.
